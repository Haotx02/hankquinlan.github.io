<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2> Education</h2>
<p>
I'm <strong>Yufeng Hao</strong>, currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Systems Engineering at <strong>Cornell University</strong>, with a GPA of 4.06/4.4. My curriculum blends optimization, simulation, and data science, including courses in Simulation Modeling, System Analysis & Optimization, Machine Learning, and Big Data Technology.
</p>
<p>
Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in <strong>Mathematics at Syracuse University</strong> (GPA: 3.674/4.0), where I built a strong foundation in linear algebra, real analysis, abstract algebra, and probability theory.

<h2> Research Projects</h2>

<h3> Football Club Valuation Model</h3>
<p>
As part of a graduate research project at Cornell, I led the design and development of a <strong>Python-based valuation system</strong> for evaluating the financial and operational health of European football clubs. I managed a cross-functional team, coordinated tasks, and implemented advanced financial techniques such as Discounted Cash Flow and P/E analysis.
</p>
<p>
To structure the system, I used SysML, context diagrams, and use case modeling to clarify user needs and design architecture. The model integrated real-time financial data and provided dynamic visualizations for investor-facing insights. This tool enables data-driven decisions for both managerial and investment purposes, significantly improving transparency and forecasting accuracy in the sports finance domain.
</p>

<h3> Workplace Diversity Simulation</h3>
<p>
In this simulation study, I developed a <strong>Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC)</strong> model to assess how diversity-oriented HR policies affect workplace composition. The model captured recruitment, promotion, and exit flows of employees, simulating a wide range of policy interventions.
</p>
<p>
I evaluated scenarios such as female-prioritized promotion, diversity-based hiring, and external senior recruitment under structural barriers. The simulation revealed nuanced interactions between policy combinations, offering strategic insights for inclusive organizational design.

<h2> Internship Experience</h2>

<h3> COFCO Coca-Cola Beverages (Beijing) Ltd. — Marketing Data Intern</h3>
<p>
At Coca-Cola, I worked in the marketing analytics department, where I handled data cleaning and transformation of high-volume market datasets. I improved data accuracy by 95% through systematic cleaning and validation techniques, which boosted the efficiency of downstream marketing analysis.
</p>
<p>
I translated raw numbers into key business metrics such as income trends, market share, and YoY growth. I also built dashboards and visualizations for regional sales analysis, which supported data-driven strategic planning and campaign evaluations.
</p>

<h3> Huaneng Guicheng Trust Co., Ltd. — Investment Intern</h3>
<p>
During my internship at Huaneng Trust, I analyzed capital market trends and performed weekly evaluations of trust company performance. My recommendations helped reduce risk exposure by 12%. I contributed to commodity price forecasting and procurement strategy optimization, resulting in a 7% reduction in procurement cost.
</p>
<p>
I also created over 30 professional reports across three departments, using Excel tools such as pivot tables and VBA scripting. My work enhanced stakeholder understanding and improved decision-making in the firm’s investment and risk management operations.
