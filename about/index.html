  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm <strong>Yufeng Hao</strong>, a Systems Engineering Master's student at Cornell University. I previously earned my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Syracuse University.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m interested in optimization, reliability analysis, and applying systems thinking to engineering and risk analysis problems. My current research explores aircraft landing safety, focusing on wake vortex and runway occupancy.

    Outside of academics, I enjoy playing soccer, photography, and practicing calligraphy.
